# 🚀 Improvement Backlog

This document is the authoritative, ranked backlog for the Zero transpiler project. It mirrors the format used in the main AI Knowledge Library.

## Working Protocol

This protocol applies to every worked task in the Zero project:

1. **Open a task journal.** Record your steps in a `YYYY-MM-DD_task_name.md` file if the task is complex.
2. **Re-evaluate the model.** Pick the least expensive available model (e.g., local Ollama, Claude, or Gemini) that can do the job well for the Zero transpiler.
3. **Route the crafted skills.** Check `.agents/skills/zero_transpiler/SKILL.md` before planning.
4. **Scan for helpful free tools.** Ensure you aren't rebuilding something already available.
5. **Finish the loop.** Every code change ships with relevant tests. Run Go builds (`go build`) and Python script validations before committing.

## Ranked Backlog (best ROI first)

Pending rows are ranked by a diminishing-returns score:

**Score = (Value × Decay) ÷ Effort**
- **Value (1–8):** pain or risk removed if the item ships.
- **Decay:** geometric halving per already-shipped item in the same theme (1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25 …).
- **Effort (1–8):** roughly log-scale; 1 = minutes, 8 = weeks.

| # | Improvement | Status | Score (V×D÷E) | Claude model | Gemini model | ROI rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Add Routing Support](#1-add-routing-support) | Done | — | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Highest value to allow building web apps with multiple endpoints instead of just the root path. |
| 3 | [Extend Python Orchestrator Grammar](#3-extend-python-orchestrator-grammar) | Done | — | Haiku 3 | Gemini 1.5 Flash | Must update the grammar in `orchestrator.py` immediately after adding new Go AST features so the LLM can use them. |
| 2 | [Add Conditionals and Variables](#2-add-conditionals-and-variables) | Done | — | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Necessary for basic logic flow in handlers (checking methods, parsing headers). |
| 4 | [Add Database Connections (SQL)](#4-add-database-connections-sql) | Done | — | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Crucial for dynamic data and actual web service capabilities. |
| 5 | [Add JSON Request/Response Handling](#5-add-json-requestresponse-handling) | Pending | 0.3125 (5×0.125÷2) | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Needed to build standard REST APIs. Decay 0.125 because three Go AST features shipped. |
| 6 | [Add Function Definitions (defun)](#6-add-function-definitions-defun) | Done | — | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Critical for code modularity (DRY principle). |
| 7 | [Add Structs and Type Definitions](#7-add-structs-and-type-definitions) | Done | — | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Necessary for strict Input Validation schemas, adhering to software_development skill guidelines, and mapping SQL/JSON to Go. |
| 8 | [Add Iteration and Data Structures](#8-add-iteration-and-data-structures) | Pending | 0.75 (6×0.25÷2) | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Essential for handling arrays of SQL results (list, map, for). Without this, the language is strictly linear. Decay 0.25. |
| 9 | [Add Environment Variables Access](#9-add-environment-variables-access) | Pending | 0.75 (3×0.25÷1) | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Follows 'Secure by Default' guidelines to prevent hardcoding database credentials or secrets in S-expressions. Decay 0.25. |
| 10 | [Add External Module Imports](#10-add-external-module-imports) | Pending | 0.375 (3×0.25÷2) | Sonnet 3.5 | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Allows importing third-party Go packages, unlocking the entire Go ecosystem. Decay 0.25. |

## Details

### 1. Add Routing Support
* **Description:** Update the compiler to accept multiple `(route path handler)` definitions inside a web server block.
* **Why:** The prototype only builds a single server with a hardcoded route. Real applications need routers.
* **Impact:** 10/10 (High - blocks all web app development).

### 2. Add Conditionals and Variables
* **Description:** Introduce `let` and `if` blocks to handle internal request logic. For example: `(if (= req.method "POST") ...)`. This will require updating the Lexer to handle operators like `=` and the Code Generator to output Go `if` statements.
* **Why:** Web handlers need to implement dynamic logic based on request types and data.
* **Impact:** 8/10 (High).

### 3. Extend Python Orchestrator Grammar
* **Description:** Currently, `orchestrator.py` uses a strict regex for the proof-of-concept single endpoint. As we implement improvements 1 and 2, this regex needs to be translated into a full Context Free Grammar (CFG) using Outlines to support nested expressions and arbitrary routes.
* **Why:** The LLM agent loop breaks if it cannot generate valid syntax for new AST nodes.
* **Impact:** 4/10 (Medium - blocks orchestrator but not manual transpiler usage).

### 4. Add Database Connections (SQL)
* **Description:** Implement SQL database connections via Go's `database/sql` mapping to an S-expression like `(sql_query db "SELECT * FROM users")`.
* **Why:** Real-world applications require state and persistence.
* **Impact:** 6/10 (Medium).

### 5. Add JSON Request/Response Handling
* **Description:** Implement a way to parse JSON bodies into variables and output JSON responses cleanly via `encoding/json`. E.g., `(parse_json req.body)` and `(res_json 200 data)`.
* **Why:** The modern web runs on JSON; text/plain is insufficient.
* **Impact:** 5/10 (Medium).

### 6. Add Function Definitions (defun)
* **Description:** Allow defining standard functions `(defun name (args) body)` outside of routes that can be called anywhere.
* **Why:** Needed to adhere to modularity and DRY principles.
* **Impact:** 8/10 (High).

### 7. Add Structs and Type Definitions
* **Description:** Implement `(struct Name (field type) ...)` to enforce Go's strict typing system for parsing JSON and scanning SQL rows.
* **Why:** Strictly typed inputs are a core requirement of defensive programming and input validation.
* **Impact:** 7/10 (High).

### 8. Add Iteration and Data Structures
* **Description:** Support loops `(for ...)` and basic collections `(list ...)` and `(dict ...)`.
* **Why:** Essential for mapping over database query results or iterating through JSON arrays.
* **Impact:** 6/10 (Medium).

### 9. Add Environment Variables Access
* **Description:** Introduce a `(env "KEY")` node to retrieve environment variables.
* **Why:** Vital for securely injecting database credentials and API keys without hardcoding them in the S-expressions.
* **Impact:** 3/10 (Low/Medium - security critical).

### 10. Add External Module Imports
* **Description:** Allow defining `(import "github.com/pkg")` at the root level to pull in external Go code.
* **Why:** Makes Zero extensible and leverages the massive open-source Go ecosystem.
* **Impact:** 3/10 (Low - advanced feature).
