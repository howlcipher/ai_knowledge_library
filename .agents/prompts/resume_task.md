# Resume an In-Flight Task

A previous session was interrupted (session limit, power outage, cleared chat). Continue its work from the journal alone.

1. List `documentation/task_journals/` (ignore `TEMPLATE.md`). If no journal exists, nothing is in flight: say so and suggest `work_next_item` instead.
2. If several journals exist, resume the one named in the invocation arguments; with no argument, resume the most recently modified.
3. Read the journal's Summary, Pre-Flight Re-Evaluation, Progress Log, and Next Step. Verify its claims against the working tree, `git status`, and `git log` before acting; the interruption may have lost or half-applied work.
4. Continue from the Next Step line, following the Working Protocol in `improvements.md`, and close the item per that protocol: tests, end to end verification, commit, mark Done, delete the journal in the final commit, push.
